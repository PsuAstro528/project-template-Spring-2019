# Astro 528 Class Project

#### Goals:  
- Put software development skills learned during class and lab exercises into practice on a real world problem
- Gain experience optimizing real scientific code
- Gain experience parallelizing a real scientific code 
- Investigate how performance scales with problem size and number of processors
- Share lessons learned with the class

Prior to the code review, update this readme, so as to make it easy for your peer code reviewer to be helpful.  What should they know before starting the review?  Where should they look first?  

Remember to commit often, push your repository to GitHub and create a pull request as if you wanted to merge your work (presumably in your master branch) into the original branch (which contains the starter code).
